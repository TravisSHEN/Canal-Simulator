# Reflection of Project Canal Simulator

## Introduction

The system to be implemented in this project is a simulator of a circular canal
with a lock, which simulating the process of canal that letting vessels coming
from downstream via lock to upstream of canal. In order to implement the
simulator for canal, the concept of concurrency programming that allowing
multiple threads to process at the same time is maily used. 


## Evaluation of success for implementation

The implementation of the system is overall successful by overlooking the
results from implemented simulator that allowing vessels ( the number
of vessels must be under or equal the number of sections ), which generated by
Producer, enter lock one by one by a exponential distribution time 
interval of ARRIVAL_TIME from downstream by draining the water in lock
, and then fills water by operator to let vessels passed into first section 
by a launch tug boat. The movement of vessels in canal
that splitted into several sections is via tug boats between section and
successor section. By looking into results of simulation, vessels in canal can
be moved via tug boats through all sections by a TOWING_AWAY time. And when
there are multiple vessels in canal, when one vessel need to move to next
section, it will check if next section is empty and wait until the section to be
empty and then move in. After moving through all sections, the vessel arrives
back at the lock if lock is filled by operator and unoccupied, then it will move
in and get down to downstream. 
Moreover, the chamber automatically fills or drains by Operator when there is no
vessel in lock so that lock can allow next coming vessel either from canal or
from outside of canal.
However, the shortage of the implementation is that it only allow one direction
in canal, which is not realistic enough to simulate the process of a canal that
allowing vessels coming from both way.  


## Design of simulator
The main decision in implementing conccurency programming concept is using
monitor that allowing the object to be locked when a thread is processing it so
that the concurrency problems like mutual exclusion, deadlock, starvation and
livelock can be easily solved. By using monitor for threads, according to which
objects are processed in the thread, then use these objects as monitor and
carefully design the condition that cause thread to wait until waken up again
and run by other threads once they release the object. For example, when
Producer thread is processing Lock object, we use Lock as monitor and lock up
this lock object so that other threads like Return_tug, Launch_tug threads
cannot process "lock" object at the same which avoid memory inconsistence
problem. Moreover, by using keywords "synchronized" for methods and "volatile"
for variables in Object Lock and Section that satisfy mutual exclusion 
that only one thread is active at its critical section at a time.

Moreover, using monitor that control which threads are wating or active can be
more efficient and safe since threads don't need to keep running if their
conditions of process are not satisfied. And this can avoid deadlock and
starvation of multiple threads that threads can finally succeed in their
critical sections when satisfying conditions at begining.

## Summary
Implementing simulator for any real process by enter parameters can let us to
easily examine what will happen during process. By using example of canal
simulator, the behavior of process for canal can be replicated in simulator as
well as the unexpected situation like traffic jam in canal can also be exmined
in simulation. Futhermore, the solution of these problems can be expected and
try to come up with solutions to avoid any unexpected things happen in real
world.
